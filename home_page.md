  Header:

Who Uses Lokul?
Font: Inter Bold, 48px, centered
Three Large Cards (Horizontal layout):
Card 1: The Privacy-Conscious
Image: Illustration: Person working on laptop, lock icon nearby
Headline:

"I don't trust cloud AI with my thoughts"
Font: Inter Semibold, 24px, charcoal
Body:

Writers, therapists, lawyers, and anyone
working with sensitive information.

Your journal entries, client notes, and
private thoughts stay private.

Because they never leave your device.
Quote (Optional):

"I use Lokul for therapy journaling.
Finally, an AI I can actually trust."

- Sarah K., Clinical Psychologist
  Font: Inter Italic, 16px, gray

Card 2: The Digital Nomad
Image: Illustration: Person on airplane with laptop
Headline:

"I need AI that works anywhere"
Font: Inter Semibold, 24px
Body:

Travelers, remote workers, and people
with unreliable internet.

Write blog posts on flights.
Code at the beach.
Plan trips in remote cafes.

Download once at home. Use everywhere.
Quote:

"Wrote my entire newsletter on a
14-hour flight. Zero WiFi needed."

- Marcus T., Digital Nomad

Card 3: The Budget-Conscious
Image: Illustration: Money with cross through it
Headline:

"I'm tired of $20/month subscriptions"
Font: Inter Semibold, 24px
Body:

Students, freelancers, and anyone who
thinks AI shouldn't require subscriptions.

ChatGPT Plus: $240/year
Claude Pro: $240/year
Lokul: $0/year

Same quality. Zero cost.
Quote:

"Canceled my ChatGPT subscription.
Haven't looked back."

- David L., Freelance Developer

SECTION 7: TECHNICAL TRUST (For Skeptics)
Background:

- Dark (#1A1A1A)
- Code-like aesthetic
  Header:

"How Do I Know It's Really Private?"
Font: Inter Bold, 42px, white, centered
Subheader:

Fair question. Here's the proof:
Font: Inter Regular, 20px, light gray
Three Proof Points:
Proof 1: Open Source

✓ All Code is Public

Every line of code is on GitHub.
Audit it yourself. Fork it. Modify it.

No hidden tracking. No secret servers.
What you see is what you get.

[View Source Code →]
Button: White text, orange border

Proof 2: Zero Network Activity

✓ Test It Yourself

1. Open browser dev tools
2. Go to Network tab
3. Use Lokul
4. Watch: Zero requests sent

Your browser doesn't lie.
If data was being sent, you'd see it.

[See How to Test →]

Proof 3: Architecture

✓ Can't Send Data (By Design)

There's no server to send data to.
Everything runs client-side.

WebGPU processes AI in your browser.
IndexedDB stores conversations locally.

It's not about trust. It's about math.

SECTION 8: FAQ (Objection Handling)
Background:

- Clean, readable
  Header:

Questions?
Font: Inter Bold, 48px, centered
FAQ Items (Accordion Style):
Q1:

❓ Is it really free? What's the catch?

▼ [Click to expand]
Expanded:

Yes. Actually free. No catch.

The AI models we use (Phi, Llama, Mistral) are
open source and free to use.

The code is open source and free to use.

There's no server to pay for (because there
is no server).

We might add optional premium features later
(like cloud sync for those who want it), but
the core product will ALWAYS be free.

This isn't a free trial. It's just free.

Q2:

❓ How good is it compared to ChatGPT?

▼ [Click to expand]
Expanded:

Honest answer: It depends.

Quick Mode (80MB):

- Good for simple questions
- Faster than ChatGPT
- Works anywhere

Smart Mode (2.8GB):

- Comparable to ChatGPT 3.5
- Great for most tasks
- Still works offline

Genius Mode (6.4GB):

- Approaching ChatGPT 4
- Best for complex reasoning
- Requires powerful device

The gap is closing fast. And unlike ChatGPT:
✓ Lokul works offline
✓ Lokul costs $0
✓ Lokul doesn't train on your data

Try both. Decide for yourself.

Q3:

❓ Will this work on my computer?

▼ [Click to expand]
Expanded:

If you have:

- Chrome 113+ or Edge 113+
- 4GB+ of available RAM
- A graphics card (even integrated graphics)

Then yes, it'll work.

We've tested on:
✓ MacBooks (M1, M2, M3, Intel)
✓ Windows laptops (HP, Dell, Lenovo)
✓ Linux desktops

Try Quick Mode first (works on almost anything).
Smart Mode needs more power.

Don't have a powerful device?
You can still use Quick Mode - it's surprisingly good.

Q4:

❓ Can you see my conversations?

▼ [Click to expand]
Expanded:

No. And we can prove it.

1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Use Lokul
4. Watch: Zero network requests

Your conversations never leave your browser.
We literally CAN'T see them. The architecture
doesn't allow it.

Plus, we're open source.
Audit the code yourself: github.com/lokul

If you find tracking, we'll give you $10,000.
(Spoiler: You won't find any.)

Q5:

❓ What happens to my conversations if I clear my browser?

▼ [Click to expand]
Expanded:

They're deleted. Forever.

Lokul stores everything locally in your browser.
Clear browser data = conversations gone.

This is by design. Privacy means you're in control.

Want to keep conversations?
Export them before clearing:

- Markdown (.md)
- Text (.txt)
- JSON (for backup)

You can also import them back later.

Q6:

❓ Is this legal?

▼ [Click to expand]
Expanded:

Yes! 100% legal.

The AI models we use are open source and
licensed for commercial use:

- Phi (Microsoft - MIT License)
- Llama (Meta - Llama License)
- Mistral (Mistral AI - Apache 2.0)

This isn't piracy. This is how open source
is supposed to work.

The big AI companies want you to think AI
requires massive servers and subscriptions.

It doesn't.

Your laptop is powerful enough.
