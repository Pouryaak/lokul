# State: Lokul

**Project:** Privacy-first AI chat that runs 100% in the browser using WebGPU
**Status:** Phase 2 in progress
**Updated:** 2026-02-18

---

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Privacy by architecture, not by promise — Users can verify with their own eyes (DevTools Network tab) that conversations never leave their device

**Target Users:**
1. Privacy-Conscious Professionals (developers, writers, researchers)
2. Offline Workers (students, travelers, remote workers)
3. Open Source Enthusiasts (GitHub, HN, Reddit community)

**Success Metrics:**
- 10,000+ GitHub stars in first 6 months
- 70%+ first message completion rate
- < 30 seconds first load (Quick Mode)
- < 3 seconds average response time
- < 5% crash rate

## Current Position

**Phase:** Phase 2 in progress
**Plan:** 02-02 complete (2 of ? plans in Phase 2)
**Status:** Chat UI components complete, ready for integration

**Progress:**

```
[=====>..............] 25% (Phase 2 in progress)
```

**Phases:**
- [x] Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (4/4 plans complete)
  - [x] 01-01: Type definitions, storage, GPU detection

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Made

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-17 | 5-phase roadmap structure | Standard depth, natural delivery boundaries from requirements |
| 2026-02-17 | Phase 1 = Infrastructure first | Web Worker architecture must be established early; refactoring later is expensive |
| 2026-02-17 | Phase 4 = Memory before Polish | Memory system is core differentiator; polish can come after |
| 2026-02-17 | Use WebLLM's WebWorkerMLCEngineHandler | Reduces complexity, follows library best practices |
| 2026-02-17 | Adapt DownloadProgress to WebLLM's InitProgressReport | WebLLM uses progress (0-1), timeElapsed, text instead of loaded/total |
| 2026-02-17 | Export selector hooks from modelStore | Prevents unnecessary component re-renders |
| 2026-02-17 | Landing page as 11-section marketing page | Full conversion funnel from home_page.md design |
| 2026-02-17 | Use shadcn/ui patterns with CVA for variants | Consistent, composable component API |
| 2026-02-17 | StatusIndicator fixed bottom-left | Always visible without interfering with content |
| 2026-02-17 | PerformancePanel toggleable from top-right | Available when needed, hidden by default |
| 2026-02-18 | Use crypto.randomUUID() for IDs | Standard, cryptographically secure ID generation |
| 2026-02-18 | Auto-generate conversation titles from first message | User-friendly, reduces manual title entry |
| 2026-02-18 | Export selector hooks from chatStore | Prevents unnecessary re-renders in components |
| 2026-02-18 | Custom chat components vs pre-built libraries | Libraries not installed; custom components follow design language |

## Session Continuity

**Last Action:** Completed 02-02 Chat UI Components
**Next Action:** Execute 02-03 Chat Interface Integration
**Context Hash:** phase2-chat-ui-20260218

**Key Files:**
- `/Users/poak/Documents/personal-project/Lokul/.planning/PROJECT.md` - Project definition
- `/Users/poak/Documents/personal-project/Lokul/.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` - v1 requirements (56 total)

## Notes

- Research flagged Phase 4 (Memory System) as HIGH complexity — may need additional research during planning
- Phase 3 (Model Management) flagged as MEDIUM complexity for download UX patterns
- All 56 v1 requirements mapped to exactly one phase with 100% coverage
