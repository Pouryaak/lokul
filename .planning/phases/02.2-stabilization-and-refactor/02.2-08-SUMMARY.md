# Phase 02.2 Plan 08 Summary

Threaded cancellation and Result/AppError semantics deeper into AI model lifecycle and transport orchestration.

## Delivered

- Added cancellation taxonomy + retryability helpers via `src/types/index.ts` and `src/lib/utils/errors.ts`.
- Added `initializeSafe` and `generateSafe` Result-based inference APIs in `src/lib/ai/inference.ts`.
- Added bounded retry with jitter and circuit-breaker state transitions in `src/lib/ai/model-engine.ts`.
- Updated transport to use request-scoped abort propagation through `inferenceManager.generateSafe` in `src/lib/ai/webllm-transport.ts`.

## Verification

- `npm run type-check` passes.
- `npm run lint` still fails on unrelated pre-existing lint baseline issues.
