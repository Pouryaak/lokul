# Phase 02.2 Plan 09 Summary

Refactored oversized app shell, sidebar, and chat interface files below target line limits and added focused lint guards for these regression-prone surfaces.

## Delivered

- Split sidebar UI into composable pieces in `src/components/chat-layout/app-sidebar-parts.tsx` and `src/components/chat-layout/sidebar-time.ts`.
- Reduced `src/components/chat-layout/AppSidebar.tsx` to orchestration-only composition.
- Split chat rendering/input/error UI into `src/components/Chat/ai-chat-parts.tsx` and simplified `src/components/Chat/AIChatInterface.tsx`.
- Rebuilt `src/App.tsx` into a slimmer app shell while preserving route/model bootstrap behavior.
- Added size guard rules for key files in `eslint.config.js`.

## Line Count Check

- `src/components/chat-layout/AppSidebar.tsx`: 159 lines
- `src/components/Chat/AIChatInterface.tsx`: 99 lines
- `src/App.tsx`: 160 lines

## Verification

- `npm run type-check` passes.
- `npm run lint` still fails due pre-existing lint issues unrelated to this plan.
